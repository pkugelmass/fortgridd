# FortGridd Handoff Document (2025-04-09 - End of Session)

*(Purpose: To capture the immediate next steps and context for the next work session, not to restate the entire project roadmap or completed tasks.)*

## Project Context

*   **Project:** FortGridd - Turn-based tactical survival game.
*   **Current Branch:** `develop 2`
*   **Last Major Action:**
    *   Fixed player starting ammo initialization in `js/main.js` to correctly use `PLAYER_START_AMMO`.
    *   Added safe zone checks to `getValidMoves` and `findNearbyResource` in `js/ai/ai_helpers.js` to prevent AI from voluntarily moving into the storm.
    *   Verified knockback can still push units into the storm.
    *   Updated `TASKS.md` accordingly.
    *   *(Suggested Commit Title: `fix: Correct player start ammo & prevent AI storm movement`)*

## Next Task & Plan: Strategic Planning

The core implementation phase for the AI Finite State Machine (FSM) and associated behaviors (resource seeking, engaging, fleeing, healing, basic storm avoidance) feels largely complete.

The next step is to have a strategic discussion to plan the short-to-medium term direction for the project.

**Plan for Next Session (Discussion Points):**

1.  **Review Current State:** Briefly assess the stability and functionality of the AI FSM implementation.
2.  **Prioritize Next Phase:** Discuss the relative importance and desired order for tackling the following areas:
    *   **Testing:** How critical is it to catch up on unit tests for the recent AI logic (`ai.test.js`, state handlers, helpers) versus proceeding with new features?
    *   **Refinement/Refactoring:** Are there specific areas in the AI logic or elsewhere that need immediate cleanup or architectural improvement (e.g., `ai_helpers.js` size, movement safety checks)?
    *   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Is now a good time to start implementing UI improvements (like sequential AI turns) or should we focus on gameplay/logic first?
    *   **Further AI Tuning:** Beyond the basic thresholds, how should we approach the next level of AI tuning (e.g., positional evaluation, target selection refinement, risk assessment)? What's the process (playtesting, specific scenarios)?
    *   **Other Roadmap Items:** Revisit the broader roadmap in `PROJECT.md` â€“ are there other features (combat enhancements, resource harvesting) that should be prioritized?
3.  **Define Next Concrete Tasks:** Based on the discussion, identify and clearly define the next 1-3 specific, actionable tasks to add to `TASKS.md`.

*(Note: This planning session will guide the subsequent development work.)*
