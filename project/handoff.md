# Handoff Note - 2025-04-10 (Evening)

## Context
We are in the process of overhauling the unit tests for the FortGridd project, following the plan outlined in `project/TASKS.md` under "Comprehensive Unit Testing Overhaul". We also created `project/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md` to guide this process, emphasizing testing core logic and behavior over brittle checks like exact log messages.

## Accomplishments
*   **Testing Guidelines:** Created `project/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`.
*   **Test Helpers:** Created `tests/test-helpers.js` with functions for mocking game state, units, and constants, including robust mocking for `Game.logMessage`.
*   **`js/utils.js` Tests:**
    *   Split original tests into `tests/utils/` directory (`traceLine.test.js`, `knockback.test.js`, `positioning.test.js`, `resources.test.js`).
    *   Implemented tests for all functions.
    *   Fixed various failures, particularly related to logging assertions and constant handling, aligning with guidelines. (Note: `traceLine.test.js` has a comment about an intermittent global QUnit failure despite passing assertions).
*   **`js/config.js` Tests:**
    *   Refactored `tests/config.test.js` to focus on type and range checks, removing brittle value checks.
    *   Added comments to `js/config.js` indicating tested ranges.
    *   Fixed failures related to non-existent constants.
*   **`js/gameState.js` Tests:**
    *   Created `tests/gameState.test.js` with a test verifying constructor default values.
*   **`js/map.js` Tests:**
    *   Introduced `TILE_BOUNDARY` constant in `config.js` and updated `map.js` generation logic.
    *   Created `tests/map.test.js` testing `countWallNeighbours` and `createMapData` structure/validity.
*   **`js/player.js` Cleanup:** Deleted the now-redundant `js/player.js` file and removed it from `index.html` and `tests/test-runner.html`.
*   **`js/playerActions.js` Tests:**
    *   Created `tests/playerActions.test.js`.
    *   Implemented tests for `handleMoveOrAttack`, `handleHeal`, and `handleShoot`.
    *   **NOTE:** The last operation involved writing these tests using `write_to_file`, which may have included extraneous text at the end of the file. The user indicated they would clean this up manually.
*   **Documentation:** Kept `project/TASKS.md` updated with completed items.

## Current Status
*   Unit tests for `utils.js`, `config.js`, `gameState.js`, `map.js`, and `playerActions.js` are implemented (pending user cleanup of `tests/playerActions.test.js`).
*   The test runner (`tests/test-runner.html`) includes all necessary source and test files up to this point.
*   `project/TASKS.md` reflects the completed work.

## Next Steps (From `project/TASKS.md`)
1.  **Verify `tests/playerActions.test.js`:** Ensure the file is clean after manual cleanup by the user and that all tests pass.
2.  **Proceed to AI Testing:** Begin planning and implementing tests for the AI modules (`js/ai.js` and files within `js/ai/*`), following the established guidelines. This involves testing:
    *   Core AI logic (`js/ai.js` - e.g., `performReevaluation`, `executeAiTurns` if applicable).
    *   AI helper functions (`ai_map_utils.js`, `ai_perception.js`, `ai_movement.js`, `ai_actions.js`).
    *   Individual AI state handlers (`state_*.js`).
