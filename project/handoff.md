# FortGridd Handoff Document (2025-04-09 - End of Day)

This document summarizes the status of the AI Finite State Machine (FSM) development within the `develop 2` branch after debugging the AI Medkit Usage logic.

## Project Context

*   **Project:** FortGridd - Turn-based tactical survival game.
*   **Current Branch:** `develop 2`
*   **Goal:** Implement Phase 2 (AI Evolution) features, focusing on the Finite State Machine (FSM).

## Last Completed Actions (Debugging AI Healing)

*   **Initial Implementation:** Implemented `AI_STATE_HEALING` logic (state, thresholds, helpers, handlers).
*   **Debugging Round 1 (AI Not Healing):**
    *   Updated `js/config.js`: Set `AI_START_MEDKITS` to `1`, consolidated healing thresholds to `AI_HEAL_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD`, added `AI_SEEK_AMMO_THRESHOLD`.
    *   Updated `js/ai/ai_helpers.js` (`performReevaluation`) to use new/renamed constants.
*   **Debugging Round 2 (Game Freeze):**
    *   Refactored `performReevaluation` function from `js/ai/ai_helpers.js` to `js/ai.js` for better organization.
    *   Corrected resource access in `performReevaluation` (now in `js/ai.js`) to use `enemy.resources.medkits` and `enemy.resources.ammo`.
    *   Corrected resource access in `useMedkit` (`js/ai/ai_helpers.js`) to use `enemy.resources.medkits`.
    *   Corrected resource access in `handleHealingState` (`js/ai/state_healing.js`) to use `enemy.resources.medkits` and ensure it returns `true`.
    *   Identified and fixed a `ReferenceError` by adding the missing script tag for `js/ai/state_healing.js` in `index.html`.
*   **Cleanup:** Removed temporary debug logs from `js/ai/state_healing.js` and restored `updateLogDisplay()` call in `js/game.js`.

## Current Task Status (from TASKS.md)

*   `[x] Implement AI Medkit Usage logic (decide when to use, apply healing). (Validated: 2025-04-09 after debugging)`
    *   **Note:** Logic is now confirmed working via manual testing.

## Next Steps / Issues Identified (Pending Action)

1.  **Issue: Resources Not Picked Up After Move/Knockback** (Next to Address)
    *   **Observation:** Units landing on resource tiles due to knockback or non-seeking movement do not pick them up.
    *   **Plan:**
        *   Create `checkAndPickupResourceAt(unit, row, col)` helper in `js/game.js`. This function will check the map tile, update unit resources, update the map tile to `TILE_LAND`, log the event, and return true/false.
        *   Create `updateUnitPosition(unit, newRow, newCol)` function in `js/game.js`. This function will update unit coordinates and then call `checkAndPickupResourceAt`.
        *   Refactor all player movement (`js/input.js`), AI movement (`js/ai/ai_helpers.js`), and knockback logic (`js/game.js` or `js/main.js`) to use `updateUnitPosition`.

## Agreed Next Action

*   Address the **Resources Not Picked Up After Move/Knockback** issue using the plan outlined above.
