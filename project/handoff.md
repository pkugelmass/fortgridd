# Handoff Note - 2025-04-10 (Evening)

## Context
We are in the process of overhauling the unit tests for the FortGridd project, following the plan outlined in `project/TASKS.md` under "Comprehensive Unit Testing Overhaul". We also created `project/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md` to guide this process, emphasizing testing core logic and behavior over brittle checks like exact log messages.

## Accomplishments
*   **Testing Guidelines:** Created `project/TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`.
*   **Test Helpers:** Created `tests/test-helpers.js` with functions for mocking game state, units, and constants, including robust mocking for `Game.logMessage`.
*   **`js/utils.js` Tests:**
    *   Split original tests into `tests/utils/` directory (`traceLine.test.js`, `knockback.test.js`, `positioning.test.js`, `resources.test.js`).
    *   Implemented tests for all functions.
    *   Fixed various failures, particularly related to logging assertions and constant handling, aligning with guidelines. (Note: `traceLine.test.js` has a comment about an intermittent global QUnit failure despite passing assertions).
*   **`js/config.js` Tests:**
    *   Refactored `tests/config.test.js` to focus on type and range checks, removing brittle value checks.
    *   Added comments to `js/config.js` indicating tested ranges.
    *   Fixed failures related to non-existent constants.
*   **`js/gameState.js` Tests:**
    *   Created `tests/gameState.test.js` with a test verifying constructor default values.
*   **`js/map.js` Tests:**
    *   Introduced `TILE_BOUNDARY` constant in `config.js` and updated `map.js` generation logic.
    *   Created `tests/map.test.js` testing `countWallNeighbours` and `createMapData` structure/validity.
*   **`js/player.js` Cleanup:** Deleted the now-redundant `js/player.js` file and removed it from `index.html` and `tests/test-runner.html`.
*   **`js/playerActions.js` Tests:**
    *   Created `tests/playerActions.test.js`.
    *   Implemented tests for `handleMoveOrAttack`, `handleHeal`, and `handleShoot`.
    *   **NOTE:** The last operation involved writing these tests using `write_to_file`, which may have included extraneous text at the end of the file. The user indicated they would clean this up manually.
*   **Documentation:** Kept `project/TASKS.md` updated with completed items.

## Current Status
*   Unit tests for `utils.js`, `config.js`, `gameState.js`, `map.js`, `playerActions.js`, `ai.js`, `ai_perception.js`, `ai_actions.js`, and `ai_movement.js` are implemented and passing (after fixing issues).
*   Refactoring of complex state handlers (`state_engaging_enemy.js`, `state_fleeing.js`, `state_seeking_resources.js`) is complete.
*   The test runner (`tests/test-runner.html`) includes all necessary source and test files up to this point, including the placeholder for `ai_map_utils.test.js` (which we skipped testing) and `state_exploring.test.js`.
*   `project/TASKS.md` reflects the completed work.

## Current Status & Next Steps
We are currently debugging persistent errors in the newly created `tests/ai/state_exploring.test.js`. Specifically, tests related to the probabilistic behavior when the AI is inside the safe zone ('Takes an action (move or wait)...') and potentially the "blocked" scenarios are failing.

**Immediate Next Step:**
1.  Carefully re-examine the failing tests in `tests/ai/state_exploring.test.js` and the corresponding source code in `js/ai/state_exploring.js`.
2.  Formulate a precise hypothesis for the cause of the failures.
3.  Apply a targeted fix using `replace_in_file`. If repeated attempts fail, consider rewriting the specific failing tests as requested by the user.
4.  Once `tests/ai/state_exploring.test.js` is passing, proceed with testing the remaining AI state handlers (`state_healing.js`, and the refactored `state_engaging_enemy.js`, `state_fleeing.js`, `state_seeking_resources.js`).
