# FortGridd Handoff Document (2025-04-09 - End of Session)

*(Purpose: To capture the immediate next steps and context for the next work session.)*

## Project Context

*   **Project:** FortGridd - Turn-based tactical survival game.
*   **Current Branch:** `develop 2`
*   **Last Major Action:**
    *   Completed strategic planning session following AI FSM implementation.
    *   Agreed to enter a "Cleanup Phase" focusing on code quality, refactoring, and test stability before proceeding with major new features or tuning.
    *   Completed the first step of the Cleanup Phase: "Quick Triage Failing Tests" (fixed/commented out immediate issues in `tests/config.test.js`, `tests/main.test.js`, `tests/ai.test.js`, and `tests/test-runner.html`).
    *   Updated `TASKS.md` with specific cleanup goals.
    *   *(Suggested Commit Title: `chore: Complete test triage and update tasks for cleanup phase`)*

## Next Task & Plan: Code Cleanup & Refactoring

Having completed the initial test triage, the next step is to prioritize and execute the refactoring and cleanup tasks identified in `project/TASKS.md` under the "Refactoring / Cleanup Tasks" section.

**Plan for Next Session:**

1.  **Prioritize Cleanup Tasks:** Review the list of cleanup tasks in `TASKS.md` (e.g., module length review, identifying refactoring opportunities, standardizing logging, cleaning up `TASKS.md`, refactoring `ai_helpers.js`, etc.). Decide on the order of execution.
2.  **Execute Chosen Task:** Select the highest priority cleanup task and begin implementation, following the project process guidelines (explain plan, implement, validate).
3.  **Continue Cleanup:** Proceed through the prioritized cleanup tasks iteratively.

*(Note: This cleanup phase aims to improve code maintainability and stability before tackling new features like UI enhancements or advanced AI tuning.)*
