# FortGridd Project Handoff Summary

## Current State (as of 2025-04-12)

- **Stable Prototype Achieved:** The project has reached its second major milestone (v2.0-prototype), with a robust AI finite state machine, comprehensive unit tests, and a stable, working prototype.
- **Codebase:** The code is well-organized, refactored, and tested. All major AI and core gameplay systems are in place.
- **Context:** An overview of the project and plans are available in the Project directory, particularly project.md and our todo list is in tasks.md.

## Current Focus: UX/UI Enhancements

The immediate goal is to make the game understandable, playable, and fun for new and returning players. This phase is not about final polish, but about exposing the right information and providing clear feedback to the player.

### Most recently we have
- As part of our effort to add better visual feedback of game events for the player, we have Implemented a new effects system (see: EFFECTS_SYSTEM.md design document and effects.js) and redone the drawing/animation loop
- Implemented a "ranged attack" effect that triggers both for the player (in playerActions.js) and the enemy (in state_engaging_enemy.js), leveraging a trigger ranged attack function in effects.js.
- We have been debugging this ranged attack effect and realized the effects system wasn't playing well with an earlier system that triggered a sleep function after every AI turn. 
- Thus we are in the middle of enhancing the events system so that every AI turn uses a Promise/async/await system to ensure the length of the turn is sufficient for all the required effects to display.

### Immediate next steps
- Continue to debug the ranged attack
- Do so by proceeding with the next steps in tasks.md.
