# FortGridd Handoff Document (2025-04-09 - End of Session 2)

*(Purpose: To capture the immediate next steps and context for the next work session.)*

## Project Context

*   **Project:** FortGridd - Turn-based tactical survival game.
*   **Current Branch:** `develop 2`
*   **Last Major Actions:**
    *   Completed initial test triage following AI FSM implementation.
    *   Cleaned up `project/TASKS.md` by moving completed items to `project/COMPLETED_TASKS.md`.
    *   Refactored `js/ai/ai_helpers.js` into smaller, categorized modules: `ai_perception.js`, `ai_movement.js`, `ai_actions.js`, `ai_map_utils.js`.
    *   Updated `index.html` and `tests/test-runner.html` to load the new AI helper scripts.
    *   Verified tests are passing after refactoring.
    *   *(Suggested Commit Title: `refactor: Break down ai_helpers.js into smaller modules`)*

## Next Task & Plan: Continue Code Cleanup & Refactoring

The next step is to continue executing the refactoring and cleanup tasks identified in `project/TASKS.md` under the "Refactoring / Cleanup Tasks" section.

**Next Specific Task:**

*   `[ ] Refactor movement safety check (avoiding known threats) into a reusable helper function in ai_movement.js and update handleFleeingState and handleEngagingEnemyState to use it.` (Discovered: 2025-04-09)

**Plan for Next Session:**

1.  **Implement Safety Check Helper:**
    *   Analyze the logic used in `js/ai/state_fleeing.js` and `js/ai/state_engaging_enemy.js` to determine if a potential move is "safe" (e.g., avoids moving adjacent to a known threat).
    *   Create a new reusable function (e.g., `isMoveSafe(enemy, targetRow, targetCol)`) in `js/ai/ai_movement.js` to encapsulate this logic.
    *   Update `handleFleeingState` and `handleEngagingEnemyState` to call this new helper function when evaluating potential moves.
2.  **Validate:** Ensure the changes work as expected and tests still pass.
3.  **Update TASKS.md:** Mark the task as complete.
4.  **Continue Cleanup:** Proceed through the remaining prioritized cleanup tasks iteratively.

*(Note: This cleanup phase aims to improve code maintainability and stability before tackling new features like UI enhancements or advanced AI tuning.)*
