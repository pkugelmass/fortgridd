# FortGridd Project Handoff Summary

## Current State (as of 2025-04-12)

- **Stable Prototype Achieved:** The project has reached its second major milestone (v2.0-prototype), with a robust AI finite state machine, comprehensive unit tests, and a stable, working prototype.
- **Codebase:** The code is well-organized, refactored, and tested. All major AI and core gameplay systems are in place.
- **Context:** An overview of the project and plans are available in the Project directory, particularly project.md and our todo list is in tasks.md. Review this document and the other documents it references to get fully ready to go.

## Current Focus: UX/UI Enhancements

The immediate goal is to make the game understandable, playable, and fun for new and returning players. This phase is not about final polish, but about exposing the right information and providing clear feedback to the player.

### Most recently we have
- As part of our effort to add better visual feedback of game events for the player, we have Implemented a new effects system (see: EFFECTS_SYSTEM.md design document and effects.js) and redone the drawing/animation loop
- Implemented a "ranged attack" effect that triggers both for the player (in playerActions.js) and the enemy (in state_engaging_enemy.js), leveraging a trigger ranged attack function in effects.js.
- Implemented a promise/async/await system to ensure events trigger sequentially/as they should
- Documented advice for adding effects in project/design/EFFECTS_SYSTEM.md
- Implemented another animation effect for player and AI movement - an effect now called by player and AI movement logic, but with a "trail" effect in which frames appeared not to clear as movement continued.
- We decided to implement a whole new animation system that would control all drawing - see project/design/ANIMATION_SYSTEM_REWRITE.md
- The animation loop is now working - see main.js, animation.js, and drawFrame.js - and we're in the process of refactoring two effects - ranged attack and movement - from effects.js to animation.js to wokr with the new loop.

### Immediate next steps
- Movement effects have started to work well & look ok. Right now we're making sure all AI movement scenarios are connected to the new animation system.
