# FortGridd Tasks (v2 - develop 2 branch)

## Phase 1: Strengthen Codebase (Started: 2025-04-08)
*(Completed foundational setup, initial tests, constant centralization, and movement/pickup refactoring. See `project/COMPLETED_TASKS.md` for details.)*

---
## Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements (Next Focus)

*   [ ] Implement Sequential AI Turn Presentation: (Added: 2025-04-09)
    *   Modify `executeAiTurns` to process AIs one by one asynchronously.
    *   Highlight current AI.
    *   Add configurable pauses (`setTimeout`) before/after AI action.
    *   Ensure display updates correctly after each action.
    *   **Crucially:** Disable player input during the entire AI sequence.
    *   Consider making pause durations configurable (via `config.js` or user setting).

*   [ ] Add new UI/UX tasks here as they are identified.

### General Process
*   [ ] Practice small, logical Git commits with clear messages.
