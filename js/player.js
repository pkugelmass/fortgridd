// console.log("player.js loaded"); // Removed module loaded log

// The global 'player' object definition has been removed.
// Player state (position, hp, resources, etc.) is now managed within the
// 'gameState.player' object, which is created and populated in js/main.js during initializeGame/resetGame.

// The 'findStartPosition' function has been moved to js/utils.js.
